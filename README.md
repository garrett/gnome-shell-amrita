Amrita
======

Welcome to the Amrita experience for GNOME 3!


Installing
----------

Make sure you copy (or symlink) this directory to a directory called "Amrita"
in ~/.themes/

Then, make sure you have the GNOME Shell Theme Selector extension installed.

Download it from:
http://fpmurphy.com/gnome-shell-extensions/themeselector-0.9.tar.gz

...and follow the instructions in its README file.


Using the theme
---------------

When done, restart gnome-shell by pressing alt-f2 and typing "r" and enter.
You will notice a flicker as gnome-shell restarts. When in overview mode,
there is a new "Themes" tab the top (next to "Windows" and "Applications").
Select "Themes" and then click on the Amrita theme to switch.


Et cetera
---------

I hope you enjoy the theme, and be sure to give me feedback!
